It can be difficult to navigate the different organisations, websites, and various bits of
advice surrounding compute and storage resources in the academic world. This lesson will
hopefully clarify what is what, who is who, and so on.

At the top, there is the [Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC)](https://www.snic.se).
SNIC is funded by the Research Council and a consortium of Swedish universities for the purpose
of providing large-scale computing and storage infrastructure for Swedish academic research.
These resources and related services are provided for free to users.

Six universities are SNIC partners, which means they host one or more SNIC systems. Uppsala
University is one of these, and [UPPMAX](https://www.uppmax.uu.se) is the high-performance
computing center at Uppsala University.

> ## SNIC centra
> The six SNIC partners are:
> - Umeå University (HPC2N)
> - Uppsala University (UPPMAX)
> - KTH Royal Institute of Technology (PDC)
> - Linköping University (NSC)
> - Chalmers Technical University (C3SE)
> - Lund University (Lunarc)
